# hacking_template
This is a general template for my Cyberpunk Red ttrpg campaign. The ascii art was generated off of https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=Type%20Something%20
I added a minimum of 3 floors since that is my personal minimum for my players.
You can add and subtract floors by repeating the if/else statements with a new floor titled "floor[Number]" for consistency.
The program will ask the players to speak to their admin if they are not authorized (More than likely they are hacking in the game).
When this is asked the player is to ask the DM what they are up against on that floor. This will keep the combat flowing. Once the player defeats the enemy
on that stage I provide them with a password as shown on floor 1 in the code in order to move forward. This will prevent them from moving forward without beating the enemy
The code could be cleaned up a bit by adding a few functions for things I repeat often, but I will get to it when I have more time.
More can always be added to this program. It is mostly just to make your netrunnning in game feel a bit more immersive.
